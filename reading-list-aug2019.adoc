=== Twitter disclosure re: PRC state-funded campaign

Twitter Safety made a statement disclosing, in their words, that they found a
'state-backed information operation focused on the situation in Hong Kong'.

Statement can be found here: https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2019/information_operations_directed_at_Hong_Kong.html

AFAIK this is the first time they've made a public statement re: state-funded operations from China.
I remember they also made a disclosure re: information operations somewhere in Africa (sorry, I know Africa's
humongous but that's the limit of what I remember).

The disclosure includes a dataset made public re: the Twitter posts and accounts in question,
and a very interesting statement:

[quote]
As Twitter is blocked in PRC, many of these accounts accessed Twitter using VPNs. However, some accounts accessed Twitter from specific unblocked IP addresses originating in mainland China.[…]

The datasets provided are massive CSV files (~800MB each) containing tweets (but presumably leaves out images and videos tweeted).

As a side-note, there's a surprisingly detailed wikipedia page re: the HK anti-extradition bill protests: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Hong_Kong_anti-extradition_bill_protests

== Security

=== SSL things

==== WordPress and Cloudflare

Cloudflare provides a link:https://www.cloudflare.com/integrations/wordpress/[free WordPress plug-in]
that sets up HTTPS on any hosted WordPress site for free.

This is 100% great, given that setting up HTTPS has always been a ordeal for laypersons
working with their hosting providers, which has made them easy prey for SSL providers
who charge for basic TLS encryption. LetsEncrypt has made this free and very much pain-free,
but still requires wrangling that the non-developer (and me) balks at.

So this free plug-in by Cloudflare is fantastic. But, of course, with a few caveats which they make clear in the docs,
but may not be obvious to anyone unfamiliar with TLS.

First, a rudimentary diagram of how Cloudflare's plug-in works:

[source]
----
 ---------           ------------           -----------
| User's  | <-(a)-> | Cloudflare | <-(b)-> | Your      |
| Browser |         | Servers    |         | WordPress |
 ---------           ------------           -----------
----

. When your WordPress instance uses the Cloudflare plug-in,
it allows the plug-in to send your content to Cloudflare's CDN services,
which Cloudflare in turn serves to users.
. Cloudflare provides a secured TLS connection at `(a)`, making sure that traffic to-and-from the user's browser. This is **very important**.
. Traffic at `(b)` is **not automatically secured** by the plug-in. You're going to have to set up SSL on your WordPress server to get that done.

So if you're using the free "Flexible SSL" option available in the WordPress Cloudflare plug-in,
your traffic is only TLS encrypted **between Cloudflare and your users**,
and is still **unsecured** between your WordPress server and Cloudflare.

This is sufficient for most use-cases, but is definitely open to exploitation e.g.
you can correlate traffic on (a) and (b) to figure out who is retrieving what
from your WordPress server, and traffic going _to_ your WordPress server is
in the clear and open to MITM manipulation.

[sidebar]
--
[edit: needed to clarify things for the hypothetical reader and myself] To be clear, any content that has been cached already by Cloudflare's CDN should only trigger traffic at (a). What happens when you're retrieving content that's not already cached by Cloudflare is something I'm not entirely clear about: does Cloudflare then begin caching the content requested, and then deliver it to the user from the CDN (likely)? Or does it transparently proxy traffic to the WordPress server, and then cache it for future requests? There are also use cases where the Cloudflare CDN is always skipped altogether, such as in the case of submitted forms, which needs to send data back to whatever server is handling the form submission. Which means that if the path between the user that submits data and the server that handles that data is insecure, then that entire path is insecure.

That's because the way TLS works is that it's an agreement between two points that send/receive traffic. In the Cloudflare TLS situation, traffic is encrypted at (a) because the user's browser and Cloudflare's CDN have **agreed** to use a shared encryption key (I probably wrote something about TLS and asymmetrical PKI somewhere, but it's not here) to make sure that only those two points can read the data being sent and received. The WordPress server is **not** part of that agreement. Subsequently, since forms _don't_ involve the CDN i.e. you need to receive and handle the data submitted, then you're talking directly to the server that is supposed to handle the data. Since there is no agreement between the user's browser and the WordPress server to share a key (and if the WordPress server is not set up with a SSL certificate, then it basically **just can't** enter into such agreements), then anything sent directly from the user's browser to the WordPress site is _exposed_, no matter what the Cloudflare CDN does.

So why, when let's say accessing the WordPress login page, does the web site still appear secure e.g. URL says protocol is `HTTPS://`, no malicious site warnings etc.? Because when you navigate to the `wp-login.php` page, all the assets e.g. HTML/CSS/Javascript/Images etc. are still being served by the Cloudflare CDN. When you enter your login details and hit `enter`, those details are sent, presumably through Cloudflare's DNS servers, and then to your WordPress server through an unsecured connection at (b). So that `https://` in your browser's address bar is only showing you part of the story.
--

I recommend getting that TLS set up on the WordPress server's end as well
by either using link:https://certbot.eff.org[certbot] or just buying a cert off your hosting provider.

==== Automagically start a HTTPS web server in Go

link:https://github.com/mholt/[mholt], the maker of the magical link:https://caddyserver.com[Caddy] web server,
has released an automagical tool for standing up a HTTPS web server: https://github.com/mholt/certmagic

[source, go]
----
package main
// Automagically start a TLS webserver
import (
    //...
    "github.com/mholt/certmagic"
)

func main(){
    mux := http.NewServeMux()
    // mux.HandleFunc...

    // instead of http.ListenAndServe(":80", mux)
    if err := certmagic.HTTPS([]string{"example.com","www.example.com"}, mux); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}

== Computer Science

=== C

Had a job interview go like this:

[source]
----
Me: I haven't done extensive API documentation, but I've worked with devs to
document a C++ API.
Them: Sends an assignment to document a 'classic' C library.
Me: !['huh'](shocked_pikachu.jpg)
----

So I spent a good portion of the week trawling through StackOverflow and
digging through of Kernighan & Ritchie's "The C Programming Language"
to at least understand some of what I was looking at.

Saved some notes for myself and anyone who accidentally finds themselves
inadvertently elbow-deep in a C library for some reason or another:

https://gist.github.com/zeddee/05ed70cff06094974aedcee4e22257fb

=== Pointers

Which brings me to `pointers`.

Have always had a vague understanding of pointers i.e.:

- A pointer is a reference to a memory address where information is stored.

But it's also an understanding that falls apart the moment I try to work with anything more complex than
having to make sure that I'm mutating the same block of data across multiple functions/method calls.

So having to grok a low-level language like link:#C[C] forced me to reckon with pointers again.

More detailed notes are found in https://gist.github.com/zeddee/05ed70cff06094974aedcee4e22257fb#pointer-operations (the same Gist as above),
but here are a few brief points I've gleaned from grappling with pointers (for reference and to clarify the thoughts floating in my head):

* `&` is a reference operator. This always get the address of the variable it's referencing.
** Getting the reference or address of a variable is useful when you want to:
*** **Pass-by-reference**: When subsequent operations _dereference_ the reference to get or manipulate the value stored at that memory address. But in order for a reference to be "used", it _must_ be dereferenced by the function using it. For example:
+
[source, go]
----
package main

import "fmt"

func main(){
    p := "this is a string"
    dereferencer(&p)
}

// dereferencer prints value of p to stdout
func dereferencer(input *string){
    fmt.Println(*input) // this resolves to *(&p)
}
----
* When attempting to retrieve or call members of a pointer, you have to put the pointer in parenthesis because of the order of resolution.
** ``*p.member`` resolves to ``*(p.member)``
** ``(*p).member`` resolves to ... well, ``(*p).member``
* The `*` operator can be used as both a **dereferencing** operator, and as an operator used to **assign** a pointer variable. (still not sure what this means tho)

=== YAML woes

Never liked YAML as a format, because it uses whitespace as a delimiter, and lets vendors do weird stuff like this:

[source, docker-compose]
----
# Example docker-compose.yml section from https://gist.github.com/usmansaleem/bb47064f406c105fdfa69716544b7b8e

----

where the pipe (`|`) character is used to start a multiline environment variable, which
then **becomes** an environment variable that can **only** be defined in a `docker-compose.yml`
file, and not in a standard `.env` file.

This becomes especially infuriating because in the above case, we'll want to store the `docker-compose.yml`
file without, in the example above, the RSA private key. That's kind of the point of `.env`
files — to allow you to store secrets securely (albeit secure insofar as the local system is secure)
and locally.

But that's all just brain vomit.
Martin Tournoij/link:https://arp242.net[arp242]'s article better articulates my frustrations with the format/language:

Martin Tournoij/arp242, "YAML: probably not so great after all", updated 15 Apr 2019 on arp242.net. Available: https://arp242.net/yaml-config.html

Summary:

* Insecure/unsafe by default, esp. re: default implementations by languages
* Difficult to parse because of its strict indentation format. Python is comparatively readable because you can delimit blocks with extra `\n`s, whereas yaml tends to come in a single large chunk.
* Complex (? can't speak to this; Martin is writing re: specs)
* Surprising behaviour. The example brought up by Martin is more of a dynamic-typed language issue i.e. `013: Tilburg` is parsed as `11: 'Tilburg'` because `013` is interpreted as an octal number. Most of the 'surprising' behaviour I've encountered are usually related to me expecting whitespace to be parsed one way, and yaml behaving in another.
* Not portable. Basically, the yaml spec tries to dictate implementations that are not practical for mainstream languages, and to me, don't make sense re: language conventions. It's also one of my main complaints: yaml just tries to do lots of weird stuff that becomes uneccessarily complex.

== Data

=== Forcing Pandas/Python to display raw numbers instead of scientific notation

I was trying to work with the above link:#twitter-disclosure-re-prc-state-funded-campaign[Twitter dataset]
using what little I knew about Python/Pandas, and immediately hit a snag: Python was displaying all numbers in scientific notation.

I _could_ suck it up and try to read it, but it's a lot easier to just work with plain
decimal notation especially when we want to get a visual sense of how
large a number is compared to the rest of the values in a table.

Looked it up, and 
link:https://stackoverflow.com/a/38691325/6042590[Sergey Bushmanov's answer]
on stackoverflow says there are 2 ways to go about it:

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|====
| Pandas/Python
| Description

| `pd.set_option('display.precision',4)`
| Forces pandas to display floats to a given precision.

|`pd.options.display.float_format = '{:.2f}'.format`
|(as far as i can tell) Tells pandas to push displayed results through a `str.format()` call.
|====

DO has a good guide on how to use string formatters here: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-string-formatters-in-python-3

I really want to get into it, but have to resign to being too time-starved to really dig into it. For now, above syntax is just magic to me.



=== Counting bits and bytes

- Counting in Computer has never been my strong point, so the point of this section is more of
just giving me a space to be an idiot and write down the obvious so my brain can process it:
- 1 bit -> 2 possibilities, 0/1
- 8 bits -> 2^8 possibilities -> 256 possibilities -> 1 byte
- In UTF8, a 1 byte character can be represented in hexadecimal notation using `U+0000` to `U+007F`, 7F in hex being 127 in decimal (because this is zero-indexed i.e. starts from 0).
- The standard ASCII character set (i.e. latin, english alphabet) requires only one byte.
- 2 bytes -> 256^2 possibilities -> 65536 possibilties -> 16 bits

Useful table from
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8[wikipedia re: UTF-8] code points:

[cols="*", options="header"]
|====
| #bytes | Bits for code point | First code point | Last code point | Byte 1 | Byte 2 | Byte 3 | Byte 4
| 1 | 7 | `U+0000` | `U+007F` | `0xxxxxxx` |  |  | 
| 2 | 11 | `U+0080` | `U+07FF` | `110xxxxx` | `10xxxxxx` |  | 
| 3 | 16 | `U+0800` | `U+FFFF` | `1110xxxx` | `10xxxxxx` | `10xxxxxx` | 
| 4 | 21 | `U+10000` | `U+10FFFF` | `11110xxx` | `10xxxxxx` | `10xxxxxx` | `10xxxxxx`
|====

So the letter `m` would be represented by `U+006D`, or character 
no. 109 in the link:https://www.asciitable.com/[ASCII table].

== Other tech things

=== cPanel and email

- **WHM**: Web Hosting Management
- Have never liked working with cPanel because of old memories of wrestling with it back in ... probably 2010 or so.
- Granted it's changed a lot, but I like being able to work with the server directly
i.e. installing, configuring, and managing Linux and software directly.
- It means I know exactly what's running and what isn't, and how to fix stuff when it breaks.
- The downside being that I can't explain how to manage it to anyone else except another admin with the same skillset or better
(which isn't a very high bar; I just know how to google stuff, `apt-get install`, and run docker).
- So when I have to diagnose, oil, maintain, and fix a system that doesn't belong to me, that aversion to cPanel kicks me in the 
ass because I have absolutely no idea what goes on inside it.
- For instance, I spent half an hour with a support agent trying to wrangle out of them the answer to
"what mailserver does <insert company name>'s shared hosting services use, and what happens to it when I migrate to a VPS?'"
- At the end of it, it was obvious that (1) they had no idea what the answer was,
and (2) it would somehow automagically work once the migration was done.
- So my guess was that they would be using one of the standard mailservers that either come with CentOS 7, or that cPanel was packing a mailserver.
- The latter guess was correct: cPanel packs it's own mailserver (or at least that's what I can tell from 
link:https://features.cpanel.net/topic/mail-only-version-of-cpanel-whm[this feature request for a dedicated mail-only cPanel distro]
, and the link:https://documentation.cpanel.net/display/82Docs/Mailserver+Configuration[Mailserver Configuration]
entry in the docs)
- Digging for this info also brought me to cPanel's link:https://documentation.cpanel.net/display/82Docs/WHM+Features+List#d331819474d144a185fd0f59a016df25[feature list], which tbh is quite impressive.
- still not something i'd spend US$15 a month (minimum) on though.
- sidenote: it also looks like they're hosting their documentation on a confluence instance, because search brings up a panel that mentions "spaces". interesting choice, and it looks like it's working well for them.

**Conclusion**: It looks like cPanel is using link:https://www.dovecot.org/[**Dovecot**] as their link:https://documentation.cpanel.net/display/82Docs/Mailserver+Configuration[mailserver].
Finding out was not fun, and I wish both <insert hosting company name here> and cPanel
were more up front about the software they deliver as part of their paid packages,
given that they're riding on _a lot_ of open source software.

== Text

A quote about reading that I found via BooksActually's Facebook 
page in 19 Aug 2014. Close to my heart, because I've got major 
problems completing books precisely because of this (and also why this
link:https://github.com/zeddee/reading-list[reading-list] exists).

[quote, Italo Calvino, If On A Winter's Night A Traveller]
Don't be amazed if you see my eyes always wandering. In fact, this is my way of reading, and it is only in this way that reading proves fruitful to me. If a book truly interests me, I cannot follow it for more than a few lines before my mind, having seized on a thought that the text suggests to it, or a feeling, or a question, or an image, goes off on a tangent and springs from thought to thought, from image to image, in an itinerary of reasonings and fantasies that I feel the need to pursue to the end, moving away from the book until I have lost sight of it. The stimulus of reading is indispensable to me, and of meaty reading, even if, of every book, I manage to read no more than a few pages. But those few pages already enclose for me whole universes, which I can never exhaust.

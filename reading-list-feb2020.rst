AI Ethics
=========

- Largest supplier of bodycams to US police, Axon,
  decides that facial recognition would be
  unethical to implement in their products.

    Axon, the company that supplies 47 out of the
    69 largest police agencies in the United States
    with body cameras and software,
    announced Thursday that it would ban
    the use of facial recognition systems on its devices.

    “Face recognition technology is not currently
    reliable enough to ethically justify its use,”
    the company’s independent ethics board concluded.

Nut graf in a nutshell
------------------------

From: https://www.thebalancecareers.com/how-to-write-a-nut-graf-that-enhances-the-story-2316024

A nut graf is a 'nutsheller':

- Justifying the point of the story
  by directing readers to the supporting material
  that helps readers see why the story is important.
- Providing a transition from the lead
  to the rest of the story.
- Telling readers why the story matters
  at this point in time.

    In most news stories, the nut graf is written in the news style,
    where the essential facts of a story are included in the first
    sentence or two of the story (known as the lead or lede).
    A good lead tries to answer
    who, what, when, where, why, and how, quickly and succinctly.

    For example, a story about unemployment statistics written
    in news style might start out with a lead like:
    "Federal grants for new job creation in booming in Chicago,
    but unemployment rates are soaring, according to statistics
    released by the Federal Employment Agency Thursday." 

    However, if the same story were written in feature style
    rather than news style, then the story would begin in a more
    narrative way. For instance, the first few paragraphs might
    start by introducing a local Chicago tradesman on unemployment
    insurance because his lack of university credentials do not
    qualify him for the jobs typically created by the federal grants.

    In the third or fourth paragraph of the story, the nut
    graf would be introduced to explain how the story rolls out,
    why it's important and would include much (but not all)
    of the information from the lead to keep the
    reader interested to read further.

- Do not give away the ending to
  your story in the nut graf.
- Think about some of the questions that
  readers might ask early on—and address the questions.
- Give readers a good reason (or hook
  to keep reading.
- Gather your thoughts about what the story
  is really about and why people should read it;
  then use one or two sentences to type out your exact thoughts.

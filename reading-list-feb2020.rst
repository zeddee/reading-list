    Axon, the company that supplies 47 out of the
    69 largest police agencies in the United States
    with body cameras and software,
    announced Thursday that it would ban
    the use of facial recognition systems on its devices.

    “Face recognition technology is not currently
    reliable enough to ethically justify its use,”
    the company’s independent ethics board concluded.

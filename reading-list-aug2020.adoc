== Tech things

=== `mvim`

Finally figured out that `mvim` wasn't working
with my `git commit --amend` and `rebase -i` commands
because (but `git commit -m` works fine) because
those tell mvim for some reason to fork its process
which git interprets as the commit_edit file closing,
and is therefore an empty commit.

To fix, have to set editor to use `mvim --nofork`/`mvim -f`
instead of just `mvim`:

[source, bash]
----
export EDITOR='mvim --nofork'
----

=== Relative imports in python

As per
link:https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports[PEP 8],
instead of:

[source, python]
----
import ./foo
----

write relative imports as:

[source, python]
----
from . import foo
----

== GREP with filenames

(ported from July 2020 reading list)

[source, shell]
----
grep -1 search\-term *.txt # list files with matches
grep -L search\-term *.txt # list files without matches

=== Implement `stub-columns` for sphinx-contrib/confluencebuilder

After several months of working with tables
that didn't allow me to set a 'header' column
in sphinx+confluence, I finally got around to
link:https://github.com/zeddee/confluencebuilder/pull/2[implementing it myself].

It's hacky, and probably not 'correct' i.e. i'm not
extending docutils correctly, but it works
and the tests pass so yeah.

So, on to documenting what my brain
tried to do while trying to get this to work:

* Had to track down where on earth we were
emitting table elements. I started off by
trawling through the code to figure out
where we were emitting HTML tags or modifying/extending
docutils. This actually took me a few weeks of intermittent
effort -- because everything was kept in storage.py.
* I was also trying to read 
link:https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/doctree.html[docutils documentation on how it crunches rST],
and â€¦ it turns out that tables are not documented:
+
image::aug2020-assets/docutils-doctree-to-be-completed.jpg["To be completed"]
* To be fair, the docutils docs also point us to the
link:https://www.oasis-open.org/specs/tm9901.htm[OASIS spec] for tables, which â€¦ I have not read because I was lazy (ðŸ˜…)
and thought it would be much faster to track down examples
of how headings in tables are handled. But the spec
does look useful.
* Also looked at the
link:https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/extdev/index.html[Sphinx ext dev docs],
but couldn't find anything specifically useful for
implementing stub-columns.
* After a bit more digging into docutils and confluencebuilder
source code, it turns out that what I want to modify
is the html `writer`. I also figured that what I specifically
wanted to find was how `th` tags are currently added
to the header rows (since `header-rows` works, even if
the confluencebuilder docs say that
link: https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/confluencebuilder/blob/master/doc/markup.rst[they aren't supported])
** tracked down implementation of tables in docutils
to here: https://svn.code.sf.net/p/docutils/code/trunk/docutils/docutils/writers/_html_base.py
** tracked down general writer code in confluencebuilder
to here: https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/confluencebuilder/blob/master/sphinxcontrib/confluencebuilder/translator/storage.py
*** which was a bit weird for me because
docutils places `visit_*` methods under `writers`
but confluencebuilder places them under `translator` --
which was confusing because i somehow associated
`translator` with docutils'
link:http://svn.code.sf.net/p/docutils/code/trunk/docutils/docutils/transforms/[`transforms`]
*** But tl;dr i found it.
** So I decided to take the plunge and edit `translator/storage.py`
directly.
*** my gut was telling me that i would need
the `visit_colspec` method, but
i didn't really want to implement `colspec`
as it's not (?) part of the HTML/5 spec
*** But turns out that as docutils traverses
(the traversal method is quite interesting as
well, but i forgot where it's put) the doctree,
it _must_ call `visit_colspec` as it traverses
a table. I haven't grasped this yet -- i don't know
what nodes are traversed where.
*** implemented feature flag, because i don't
know where this works and where this doesn't;
only tested on confluence 7.6.2 locally run
with 
link:https://github.com/teamatldocker/confluence[teamatldocker/confluence] docker image.
+
.Run with:
[source, bash]
----
docker run -d -p 80:8090 --name confluence teamatldocker/confluence
----
** first thing I tried was to modify `visit_entry`
to try and figure out if i'm targeting
table cells correctly. Thought this would be
the right thing to do because this is also where
we set `target_tag = 'th'/'td'`.
Did this by running a
few conditionals:
+
[source,python]
----
def visit_entry(self,node):
    if self._thead_context[-1]:
        target_tag = 'th'
    elif self._stub_columns_experimental and \
            CONDITION_HERE:
        print(CONDITION_HERE)
    else:
        target_tag = 'td'

"""
CONDITION_HERE:

these failed; i found instances
in the docutils code where we're
adding these as attributes,
so I thought I'd just try to add
these and run the code.
- 'stub' in node
- 'stub_column' in node

what eventually worked was:
- node.parent.parent.parent.stubs[node.parent.column]

took it from docutils/writers/_base_html.py,
which was super convoluted but worked
"""
----

** Once I did that, I just had to follow
the error messages I got when I ran the code
to figure out where I had to port more
code:
+
[source]
----
Exception occurred:
  File "/Users/zeddee/working/eiq/confluencebuilder/sphinxcontrib/confluencebuilder/translator/storage.py", line 752, in visit_entry
    elif node.parent.parent.parent.stubs[node.parent.column]:

Far better an approximate answer to the right question,
which is often vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question,
which can always be made precise.
____

Which is horrifying to me in many different ways.
** Author reads it as a call for better questions.
Maybe. But taken at face value, I think
that's giving the quote a bit of a wide berth.
Maybe reading the actual

he's quoting from would lend to that interpretation.

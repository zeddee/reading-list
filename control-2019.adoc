= Control (2019)

- House of leaves, the game.
- Ahti the janitor.
- janitorial duties as transcendent, as profound force for good

- very strange game
- 'feels like home'. the most homely game i've ever played.
- feels like I can inhabit the game space really comfortably. not common in games.

- the weird thing is: combat is not particularly good, platforming is sticky and annoying.
- but the game feels good. why?
- atmosphere/mise-en-scene is great
- worldbuilding is great

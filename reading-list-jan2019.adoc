(also link:/static/EASA-statement-on-data-governance.pdf[here])

[quote]
This statement describes some of the core methodical and ethical practices of ethnographic research.
These practices have implications for the norms and forms of data management in ethnography.
We issue this statement to help ethnographers respond to current mandates for
data archiving, storage, and sharing from
governments, universities, and funders.

== Ethereum notes

=== Go Ethereum

* Documentation for working with RLP encoded data:

=== Running Go Ethereum on Docker


==== Quirk: Geth.ipc when mounted is parsed with full docker host machine path

* If you try and run `geth` on Docker, `geth` parses the mounted local path of the `datadir` as its path,
rather than its path in the container.
* This becomes an issue if your local mount path is long.
* That's because `geth` throws a 
`Fatal: Error starting protocol stack: listen unix <container_path>/tmp/geth.ipc: bind: file name too long` error and stops
if the total number of characters for the path to`geth.ipc` is longer than 107 characters
(see https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/16342).
* For example:
+
[source, bash]
----
# Running the following throws a "file name too long" error,
# because the resulting path "/tmp/95charlocalpath_adsad.../tmp/geth.ipc" is 108 characters long.
mkdir /tmp/95charlocalpath_adsadsfadfadfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdadfadsfadsfadsfasdfasdfasdfada
cd /tmp/95charlocalpath_adsadsfadfadfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdadfadsfadsfadsfasdfasdfasdfada
docker run -ti --rm -v $(pwd):/tmp ethereum/client-go:alltools-v1.8.20 geth --dev

# But this works
mkdir /tmp/94charlocalpath_adsadsfadfadfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdadfadsfadsfadsfasdfasdfasdfad
cd /tmp/94charlocalpath_adsadsfadfadfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdadfadsfadsfadsfasdfasdfasdfad
docker run -ti --rm -v $(pwd):/tmp ethereum/client-go:alltools-v1.8.20 geth --dev
----

* The examples above run `geth --dev`, so `geth.ipc` is always on `/tmp/geth.ipc` (13 chars) in the container.
* When running `geth` on the mainnet or testnet, this path would be
`/root/.ethereum/geth/geth.ipc` (29 chars)
or `/root/.ethereum/<testnet>/geth.ipc` (32 chars for rinkeby)
respectively.
* Solution: Only mount local machine directories that are shorter than `107 - <container_path_length>` characters as the `datadir`

=== Contstaninopole delay

https://www.coindesk.com/ethereums-constantinople-upgrade-faces-delay-due-to-security-vulnerability

- Blockchain audit firm ChainSecurity found and disclosed a security vulnerability
in link:https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1283.md[EIP 1283]
one of the five improvements to be included in the chain upgrade.
- The vulnerability found by ChainSecurity apparently allows a *reentrancy* attack.
+
[quote]
____
The bug, found in Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1283, would have allowed malicious actors to essentially withdraw funds “forever” in what is known as a re-entrancy attack. 

Typically gas costs on the ethereum network can prevent such attacks. However, EIP 1283 would have lowered gas costs significantly, to the point where re-entrancy attacks could be executed in certain smart contracts. 
____
- EIP 1283 is a proposed improvement to how gas costs for storing data on-chain is calculated (? correct?)
- Specifically an improvement to "gas metering" on `SSTORE`, which is the

== Cybersecurity by Huawei

Was digging through the govtech blog for another article when I came across this:
https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/5-cybersecurity-tips-from-huawei-chief-cybersecurity-officer

They're basic ground level tips:

- Think before you click
- Passwords matter
- Say no to public wifi
- Control network access
- Education is key

I'm assuming that the tips are for the lay audience,
but they're not that useful or even up to date on
best practices. Quickly:

. Think before you click
** Generally true and correct.
- Passwords matter
** Generally true and correct.
** But important details left out.
** For example, changing passwords often has been debunked as a best practice. 
In fact, link:https://www.cesg.gov.uk/articles/problems-forcing-regular-password-expiry[forcing users]
to link:https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2016/08/18/nists-new-password-rules-what-you-need-to-know/[change passwords often]
does two things you don't want:
*** Users don't bother to come up with a strong password each time,
and tend to use variations of the same password.
*** Users start storing passwords in insecure places.
** Also, a short password that uses symbols, alphanumeric characters etc.
is not as strong as a long password that's just a series of words.
Relevant: link:https://www.xkcd.com/936/[XKCD: Password Strength] +
image:/static/xkcd_password_strength.jpg[Password strength. link=https://www.xkcd.com/936/]
** Use a password manager. Here are some good ones:
*** https://buttercup.pw/ [free; win, macos, linux]
*** https://www.lastpass.com/ [free & paid: win, macos, linux]
*** https://1password.com/ [paid: win, macos, linux]
*** _Disclaimer: remember — if it's free, you're the product_
. Say no to public wifi
** Generally true and correct.
. Control network access
** Generally true and correct.
** Does not mention that attacks go the other way as well.
Connecting to a network not only allows attacks from your device,
but also allows access to your device as well. If you're connected to your
office network, _assume that someone is watching your online activity_.
This is also a good time to mention that _your company reads your email_.
No exceptions. This is a feature *built-into* Microsoft Exchange and other
major email software services.
. Education is key
** Yes.

Though I'd like to point out that the cybersecurity interests of the public
has never been China's strong point, so I'd take this proffering of advice with
a pinch of salt:

One of the smart nation initiatives that I have been worrying about.
We know that adtech has used this badly:

- link:https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/#56e1681f6668[Target sent coupons for baby items to a teen, outing her pregnancy.]
- link:https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/2/8315897/facebook-on-this-day-nostalgia-app-bringing-back-painful-memories[Facebook's "on this day" feature is terrible.]

Anticipatory services are by default intrusive because they require an unprecedented
level of access to your personal life and communications, 
_whether or not you are aware of the data you are producing_.

Other developments to watch:

8. A smart lamp post near you

ST Engineering has been awarded a S$7.5 million contract to give lamp posts in Geylang and Buona Vista an upgrade with *Internet of Things sensors* and *cameras*. These smart lamp posts are part of the government’s efforts to create a Smart Nation Sensor Platform that allows real-time monitoring of not just *road traffic conditions*, but also *pedestrian footfall and environmental parameters such as temperature and humidity. The data collected will help inform urban and transport planning, as well as *enhance security* in Singapore.

== Bachelard, rationalism, and computation

Reading Anna Longo, "Gaston Bachelard: From Mathematical Structures to Reality",
published 1 Oct 2012 (that's whay my Pocket Reader says, but undated on site),
on _Glass-Bead: Research Platform_. Available:

Author writes about how computational thinking is limited when it comes to
reasoning about issues that are "incomputable" (similar to "intractable" in algorithmic thinking?).

== Spash Damage/Pewdiepie and media effects

According to Abidin, Everyman Empathy is crucial to the brands of even the biggest YouTube success stories. Much has been made about the concord influencers create with their followers — and how that’s made them un-cancelable in a political climate that’s otherwise quick to judgment. Fewer, though, have noticed that growing media scrutiny has given Kjellberg a way to humanize himself and deflect legitimate criticism. His proletariat gamer roots reappear on cue every time a media outlet like Vox takes his own words seriously.

____
The research on this is well-established. PewDiePie has put out a video a day for seven years. When he walks up to the line (or goes flying over it) he does so confident that his audience will be with him out of a loyalty built up over thousands of intimate videos. Alt-right shout-outs are flagrant fouls to outsiders, but young fans of YouTubers regard them as personal friends and even family members, and defend them as such. This is why Logan Paul barely lost a step after posting a fresh suicide on his channel, or why JonTron is back to making his usual gamer diatribes two years after publicly expressing his phrenology takes. The browbeating is never going to beat the infrastructure, emotional and otherwise.

I’ve personally grown tired of the media waiting for a point of no return on YouTube. PewDiePie is not going to change, and the culture in his wake is not going to change. What can change is the way we go about our coverage to re-estabish the trust and credibility needed to challenge dangerous political currents in the community.

Available: https://wishcrys.com/2018/09/23/public-shaming-peer-surveillance-and-the-profitability-of-internet-drama/],
which is *very important reading*.

== Importance of diff tools

- Diff tools allow you to quickly compare documents.
- Advanced diff tools can even allow comparisons between images (not just a file level change).
- Valuable when someone sends you a changed file
and doesn't tell you what has changed exactly.
- Valuable when you want to keep track of what you've
added in each iteration of the document.
- Even more valuable if you're keeping track of these changes
in a log e.g. day 1: change A; day 2: change B;
- Can see how this can be useful in the commit history
of this repository: https://github.com/zeddee/reading-list/commits/master

=== Using the Git `diff` tool in the command line

- `xcode-select --install` installs, among other things, `git`.
- Allows you to run `git diff <file1> <file2>` to  show the difference between files.
- Of course, this works best with text files.
- This works best if you're doing this with text files where you expect
to find differences that are useful. e.g. It is not useful to run `git diff`
on two entirely different text documents, or on two text documents where one is
a significant rework of the other.
- To work with word docs, save as plain text files (not rich text).
- Or, alternatively, convert with `pandoc -f docx -t markdown <source_filename.docx> -o <destination_filename.md>`
and diff the resulting `.md` file.

=== Other diff tools you can use

== MIT: The Ethics and Governance of AI

Opening event: Keynote by Joi Ito

* One of the core problems of ethics is that we’re not clear on what constitutes a desirable state.
* Alphago: not raw calculation or moveset possibilities, in fact closer to what we would grok as intuition and creativity (? really?)
* On AlphaGo: "So they will win"

[quote]

"So they will win. [...] Life is a game, and they will win!"
So then I realised that there are at least two categories of people
in the world: people who, like one of my friends, knows
exactly how many hours they need to spend with their wife,
knows exactly the balance of the happiness they get from their
money versus the their things, and they can basically describe
to you in, sort of, metrics, how they measure happiness.
If they can optimize for happiness, they win at life.
And so if you believe that life is a game you can win at, then you
can probably imagine that a computer can beat you at life.

But if you believe that life is not a game, like I do,
like I believe that I'm a bunch of chemicals and molecular
interactions, and every morning I wake up my endocrine
system tells me what I yearn to do that day.
And my life is about trying to fulfill the yearnings
that come through, not just my endocrine system but
my relationships and my existence in the world, and
that we have somewhat a spiritual idea that we have
a consciousness, and we have an understanding.
And the word understanding is very interesting:
when you hear people who describe OpenAI,
they get so much- they get so good at this [building AI] that
the machine understands what's going on.
That's a pretty interesting use of the word "understanding".
[goes on to explain the Chinese room thought experiment, which I won't repeat here.]

** "ORTC is an initiative involving Google, Microsoft and several other companies 
with the effort of defining an object-centric API to real time communications.
At its heart, ORTC aims to replace the current SDP interface that is used by WebRTC as the API used by developers.
The problem with SDP stems from the fact that it is hard to parse and work with using Java Script code."

=== SDP — Session Description Protocol

[quote]
SDP is the protocol used to exchange  media information between SIP endpoints, and it has also been chosen by IETF and W3C to exchange media information in WebRTC. A WebRTC peer uses SDP to inform the other end about which transport protocols, ports, codecs and  other parameters to use in a media session.

== Dealing with WebDAV folders

WebDAV is a file sharing protocol that allows you to
mount a http/https url as a folder on your local machine.
This lets you interact with it as if it was a local folder
on your hard disk.

Most of the time, you should be using S/FTP, SSH to access a foreign file system
on the internet. But sometimes, you'll run across a situation where
a cheap hosting solutions provider's plan just doesn't let you do it,
or your hosting configuration has been mangled somehow.

You can mount a WebDAV folder in two ways:

. Using your OS's file manager.
** *macOS*: In a Finder window, hit `cmd+k` and enter the url of your WebDAV endpoint. When you hit enter, it should be mounted as a network drive.
** *Windows*: 
... In Windows Explorer, right-click the *Network* location and select *Map Network Drive*.
... In Windows 10, there should be a text link at the bottom of the box that pops up, 
asking you to click it if you want to
"Connect to a Web site that you can use to store your documents and pictures".
Click that.
... Follow the on-screen instructions.

This usually gives you a sketchy connection, since a HTTP/HTTPS WebDAV connection is nowhere near as stable as
an SSH tunnel, and isn't as resilient as S/FTP. This usually isn't a problem, but when using such a connection
with your local file manager (Finder/Windows Explorer), it causes problems because file managers expect
stable and consistent connections. They'll freak out and start acting weird should the connection drop.
I've spent hours having to repeat work over and over again because Finder would stop responding when
a WebDAV connection drops or times out; it just doesn't know how to respond.

Enter solution 2:

[start=2]
. Using Cyberduck CLI (recommended)
** Install on macOS with `brew install duck`
** Run with:
+
[source,bash]
----
duck -u username -p password -l davs://<url>/<directory_to_list>/
duck -u username -p password -d davs://<url>/<file_to_download>
duck -u username -p password -d davs://<url>/<directory_to_download>/ # you must add a trailing slash to download dirs
----

Because Cyberduck is made for FTP connections, it handles WebDAV connections like FTP connections: that is, if a connection drops,
it knows not to keep waiting for it, but breaks the dropped connection and retries, while keeping track of the progress of any file
transfers etc. Saved me my sanity, and a bucketload of time (wish I'd found it sooner).

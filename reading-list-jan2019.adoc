== Data science resources

Am going through Datacamp's link:https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-scientist-with-python[python course] again,
this time grabbing the datasets
and working with Jetbrain's link:https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/[PyCharm IDE],
which has fantastic Python `venv` handling and code completion.

== Ethics and Data Governance

https://easaonline.org/downloads/support/EASA%20statement%20on%20data%20governance.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1fbW1xKa7VSycnwZ-leB3qqpQjFCakZ-5VjzNig_1doj3lq8GX-EGZl-c

----
This statement describes some of the core methodical and ethical practices of ethnographic research.
These practices have implications for the norms and forms of data management in ethnography.
We issue this statement to help ethnographers respond to current mandates for
data archiving, storage, and sharing from
governments, universities, and funders.

== Cybersecurity by Huawei

Was digging through the govtech blog for another article when I came across this:
https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/5-cybersecurity-tips-from-huawei-chief-cybersecurity-officer

They're basic ground level tips:

- Think before you click
- Passwords matter
- Say no to public wifi
- Control network access
- Education is key

I'm assuming that the tips are for the lay audience,
but they're not that useful or even up to date on
best practices. Quickly:

. Think before you click
** Generally true and correct.
- Passwords matter
** Generally true and correct.
** But important details left out.
** For example, changing passwords often has been debunked as a best practice. 
In fact, link:https://www.cesg.gov.uk/articles/problems-forcing-regular-password-expiry[forcing users]
to link:https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2016/08/18/nists-new-password-rules-what-you-need-to-know/[change passwords often]
does two things you don't want:
*** Users don't bother to come up with a strong password each time,
and tend to use variations of the same password.
*** Users start storing passwords in insecure places.
** Also, a short password that uses symbols, alphanumeric characters etc.
is not as strong as a long password that's just a series of words.
Relevant: link:https://www.xkcd.com/936/[XKCD: Password Strength] +
image:/static/xkcd_password_strength.jpg[Password strength. link=https://www.xkcd.com/936/]
** Use a password manager. Here are some good ones:
*** https://buttercup.pw/ [free; win, macos, linux]
*** https://www.lastpass.com/ [free & paid: win, macos, linux]
*** https://1password.com/ [paid: win, macos, linux]
*** _Disclaimer: remember — if it s free, you're the product_
. Say no to public wifi
** Generally true and correct.
. Control network access
** Generally true and correct.
** Does not mention that attacks go the other way as well.
Connecting to a network not only allows attacks from your device,
but also allows access to your device as well. If you're connected to your
office network, _assume that someone is watching your online activity_.
This is also a good time to mention that _your company reads your email_.
No exceptions. This is a feature *built-into* Microsoft Exchange and other
major email software services.
. Education is key
** Yes.

Though I'd like to point out that the cybersecurity interests of the public
has never been China's strong point, so I'd take this proffering of advice with
a pinch of salt:

== Anticipatory services 

- https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/five-key-features-of-the-new-moments-of-life-app
- https://govinsider.asia/digital-gov/singapore-smart-nation-e-payments-national-digital-identity-anticipatory-services/
- https://govinsider.asia/smart-gov/predictive-services-are-the-future-of-estonias-digital-government/
- https://govinsider.asia/innovation/new-zealand-launches-predictive-service-for-new-parents/
- https://govinsider.asia/innovation/new-zealand-end-of-life-service/

One of the smart nation initiatives that I have been worrying about.
We know that adtech has used this badly:

- link:https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/#56e1681f6668[Target sent coupons for baby items to a teen, outing her pregnancy.]
- link:https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/2/8315897/facebook-on-this-day-nostalgia-app-bringing-back-painful-memories[Facebook's "on this day" feature is terrible.]

Anticipatory services are by default intrusive because they require an unprecedented
level of access to your personal life and communications, 
_whether or not you are aware of the data you are producing_.

== Bachelard, rationalism, and computation

Reading Anna Longo, "Gaston Bachelard: From Mathematical Structures to Reality",
published 1 Oct 2012 (that's whay my Pocket Reader says, but undated on site),
on _Glass-Bead: Research Platform_. Available:
http://www.glass-bead.org/research-platform/gaston-bachelard-mathematical-structures-reality

Author writes about how computational thinking is limited when it comes to
reasoning about issues that are "incomputable" (similar to "intractable" in algorithmic thinking?).

== Git repositories

* Recommendation Algorithms from Microsoft [↫ https://changelog.com/nightly]
** https://github.com/Microsoft/Recommenders
* Building Electron apps with Go
** https://github.com/asticode/go-astilectron
** Seems better supported than Gotron. Astilectron works out-of-the-box for my macOS machine, but Gotron does not. Need to play with this more.
* PDF document generator for Go
** https://github.com/jung-kurt/gofpdf
** For future project where we build a PDF generator into Hugo for documentation sites.
** Need to figure out how to convert asciidoctor and markdown files into PDF using this tool first.
** Also probably need to figure out how to reliably crawl a content directory and generate a TOC or manifest, or
** Read from a TOC/manifest to generate a set of docs.

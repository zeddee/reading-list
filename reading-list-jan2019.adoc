== Security

=== Cybersecurity by Huawei

Was digging through the govtech blog for another article when I came across this:
https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/5-cybersecurity-tips-from-huawei-chief-cybersecurity-officer

They're basic ground level tips:

- Think before you click
- Passwords matter
- Say no to public wifi
- Control network access
- Education is key

I'm assuming that the tips are for the lay audience,
but they're not that useful or even up to date on
best practices. Quickly:

. Think before you click
** Generally true and correct.
. Passwords matter
** Generally true and correct.
** But important details left out.
** For example, changing passwords often has been debunked as a best practice. 
In fact, link:https://www.cesg.gov.uk/articles/problems-forcing-regular-password-expiry[forcing users]
to link:https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2016/08/18/nists-new-password-rules-what-you-need-to-know/[change passwords often]
does two things you don't want:
*** Users don't bother to come up with a strong password each time,
and tend to use variations of the same password.
*** Users start storing passwords in insecure places.
** Also, a short password that uses symbols, alphanumeric characters etc.
is not as strong as a long password that's just a series of words.
Relevant: link:https://www.xkcd.com/936/[XKCD: Password Strength]

** Use a password manager. Here are some good ones:
*** https://buttercup.pw/ [free; win, macos, linux]
*** https://www.lastpass.com/ [free & paid: win, macos, linux]
*** https://1password.com/ [paid: win, macos, linux]
*** _Disclaimer: remember — if it's free, you're the product_
. Say no to public wifi
** Generally true and correct.
. Control network access
** Generally true and correct.
** Does not mention that attacks go the other way as well.
Connecting to a network not only allows attacks from your device,
but also allows access to your device as well. If you're connected to your
office network, _assume that someone is watching your online activity_.
This is also a good time to mention that _your company reads your email_.
No exceptions. This is a feature *built-into* Microsoft Exchange and other
major email software services.
. Education is key
** Yes.

Though I'd like to point out that the cybersecurity interests of the public
has never been China's strong point, so I'd take this proffering of advice with
a pinch of salt:

=== Don't download suspicious zip files!

LiveOverFlow's a great youtube channel that walks you through various security things.

This one's pretty easy to digest. In https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry_yb5Oipq0,
LiveOverFlow explains an old vulnerability involving malicious zip files that
apparently not many developers know about (I didn't know + not a dev, but still fascinating
to see that this is a thing).

Basically, if you create a zip file that contains a certain combination of paths and files,
you can replace files on the compromised file system, and on poorly secured systems, run
executables. LiveOverFlow explains this pretty well; go watch that.

This caught my attention
because I was recently debugging a friend's wordpress installation that got hacked.
I was going through server directories, and found that the attacker basically
uploaded a few files onto the wordpress installation (not sure how; not a wp expert and didn't get that far)
and had it rewrite most of the `php` files to have it redirect to a malicious ad +
uploaded an entire HTML/CSS site onto the base `public_html` directory of the server.

All this without hacking the server; just a vulnerability in wordpress that allowed them to do it.
Pretty sure about this, because everything else was intact: the wordpress SQL database and the original site's
content files (bar `php` files).

*** Technique #3: The -D Archive Hack
***

     This technique also plays on the openness of WWIV's archive system.  This
is another method of getting a file into the root BBS directory, or anywhere on
the hard drive, for that matter.

     First, create a temporary directory on your hard drive.  It doesn't matter
what it's called.  We'll call it TEMP.  Then, make a sub-directory of TEMP
called AA. It can actually be called any two-character combination, but we'll
keep it nice and simple.  Then make a subdirectory of AA called WWIV.

     Place NETWORK.COM or REMOTE.COM or whatever in the directory
\TEMP\AA\WWIV.  Then from the TEMP directory execute the command:

PKZIP -r -P STUFF.ZIP         <--- The case of "r" and "P" are important.

     This will create a zip file of all the contents of the directories, but
with all of the directory names recursed and stored.  So if you do a PKZIP -V
to list the files you should see AA\WWIV\REMOTE.COM, etc.

     Next, load STUFF.ZIP into a hex editor, like Norton Utilities, and search
for "AA".  When you find it (it should occur twice), change it to "C:".  It is
probably a good idea to do this twice, once with the subdirectory called WWIV,
and another with it called BBS, since those are the two most common main BBS
directory names for WWIV.  You may even want to try D: or E: in addition to C:.
You could even work backwards, by forgetting the WWIV subdirectory, and just
making it AA\REMOTE.COM, and changing the "AA" to "..".  This would be
foolproof.  You could work from there, doing "..\..\DOS\PKZIP.COM" or whatever.

     Then upload STUFF.ZIP (or whatever you want to call it) to the BBS, and
type "E" to extract it to a temporary directory.  It'll ask you what file.
Type "STUFF.ZIP".  It'll ask what you want to extract.  Type """-D".  It'll
then execute:

PKUNZIP STUFF.ZIP ""-D

     It will unzip everything into the proper directory.  Voila.  The quotation
marks are ignored by PKUNZIP and are only there to trip up WWIV v4.20's check
for the hyphen.  This method can only be defeated by modifying the source code,
or taking out the calls to any PKZIP or PKUNZIP programs in INIT, but then you
lose your archive section.

Takeaways:

* Projection.
** Taking out indignance and anger on entities that are the least capable in responding.
** i.e. Bullying behaviour, punching down.
+
[quote]
____
Why do we act this way? Are we secretly terrified that robots will take our jobs? Upend our societies? Control our every move with their ever-expanding capabilities and air of quiet malice?

Quite possibly. The specter of insurrection is embedded in the word “robot” itself. It was first used to refer to automatons by the Czech playwright, Karel Capek, who repurposed a word that had referred to a system of indentured servitude or serfdom. The feudal fear of peasant revolt was transplanted to mechanical servants, and worries of a robot uprising have lingered ever since.
____

* Othering tendencies in humans.
** Literally the playing out of robot hate as portrayed on _Blade Runner 2049_
+
[quote]
____
But Agnieszka Wykowska, a cognitive neuroscientist, researcher at the Italian Institute of Technology and the editor in chief of the International Journal of Social Robotics, said that while human antagonism toward robots has different forms and motivations, it often resembles the ways that humans hurt each other. Robot abuse, she said, might stem from the tribal psychology of insiders and outsiders.

“You have an agent, the robot, that is in a different category than humans,” she said. “So you probably very easily engage in this psychological mechanism of social ostracism because it’s an out-group member. That’s something to discuss: the dehumanization of robots even though they’re not humans.”
____

* "We see ourselves in the mirror of the machines that we can build"
** Referring to the Lacanian concept of the mirrored/alienated self?
That only by disavowing the reflection, by explicit and voilent exclusion of
_that_ image can we ground securely our own sense of self + existence.
** I.e. that this robot hate is existential rather than grounded in
socio-economic realities.
** (but what's the difference?)
+
[quote]
____
In his paper “Who is afraid of the humanoid?” Frédéric Kaplan, the digital humanities chair at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland, suggested that Westerners have been taught to see themselves as biologically informed machines — and perhaps, are unable to separate the idea of humanity from a vision of machines. The nervous system could only be understood after the discovery of electricity, he wrote. DNA is necessarily explained as an analog to computer code. And the human heart is often understood as a mechanical pump. At every turn, Mr. Kaplan wrote, “we see ourselves in the mirror of the machines that we can build.”
____

* Giving robots names reduce harm to robots in specific contexts.
** Assimilation.
+
[quote]
____
“That went on until the point that the caregiver started giving names to the robots. So the robots suddenly were not just robots but Andy, Joe and Sally. At that moment, the brutal behavior stopped. So, its very interesting because again its sort of like giving a name to the robot immediately puts it a little closer to the in-group.”

____
Kate Darling likes to ask you to do terrible things to cute robots. At a workshop she organised this year, Darling asked people to play with a Pleo robot, a child’s toy dinosaur. The soft green Pleo has trusting eyes and affectionate movements. When you take one out of the box, it acts like a helpless newborn puppy – it can’t walk and you have to teach it about the world.

Yet after an hour allowing people to tickle and cuddle these loveable dinosaurs, Darling turned executioner. She gave the participants knives, hatchets and other weapons, and ordered them to torture and dismember their toys. What happened next “was much more dramatic than we ever anticipated,” she says.

=== Yet another article on Moral Machines

Caroline Lester, "A Study on Driverless-Car Ethics Offers a Troubling Look into Our Values",
published 24 Jan 2019 on the New Yorker. 
Available: https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/a-study-on-driverless-car-ethics-offers-a-troubling-look-into-our-values
(link:{assetdir}/new-yorker-driverless.pdf[pdf])

More of revealing how poorly equipped and how poorly thought through such research is.

NB: The “demos” Shariff mentions here is Greek, and refers to the general public ie. “demos” in “democracy”

[quote]
____
In its discussion, the paper skims over the uglier aspects of the study to
identify “three strong preferences” that might provide a starting point for
developing a standardized machine-ethics framework: sparing human lives, sparing
more lives, and sparing young lives. The paper concludes with a soaring look
into the future, and recasts machine ethics as a “unique opportunity to decide,
as a community, what we believe to be right or wrong; and to make sure that
machines, unlike humans, unerringly follow these moral preferences.” But, when I
asked Shariff what he thought of the human prejudice shown in the data, he
laughed and said, “That suggests to us that we shouldn’t leave decisions
completely in the hands of the demos.”

The U.S. government has clear guidelines for autonomous weapons—they can’t be
programmed to make “kill decisions” on their own—but no formal opinion on the
ethics of driverless cars. [...]
____

and here even more starkly we can see how underequipped the general public, the
news agencies reporting on this, and the legislative bodies are to deal with the
topic. they don't even know what the correct question is, and that they're
missing it. for instance, the new yorker post goes on about the values reflected
in the: "Players in Eastern-cluster countries were more likely than those in the
Western and Southern countries to kill a young person and spare an old person
(represented, in the game, by a stooped figure holding a cane)." but completely
misses the point of ethical dilemmas — that the exercise is set up such that you
are forced to pick a side that is the least bad. You lose either way, so you
might as well pick the choice that, according to your ethical framework,
minimizes loss in the situation. the correct take away is that we're at level 0
_across the board_ on autonomous vehicles because we still don't have a viable
mental framework to even locate autonomous machines of consequence in public
life. But yet it's still creeping in — delivery bots are already out there, and
delivery drones are on the way. But still wildly different from bots of
significance — where "kill decisions" have to be made at a point. And we'll
never be able to get this right until we get the mental framework right. 

---

on autonomous vehicles, the solutions are actually very simple. Don't programme a
kill decision into it. Make it very clear that the vehicle is (1) incapable of
making such a kill decision, and (2) will _never_ be put in such a situation
where they are (a) _required to_ and/or (b) _they have the autonomy to make_ a
kill decision. hamstrung? maybe. but it makes the most sense, and guess what,
we've already imagined it. the autonomous container trucks in the not-wolverine
movie Logan (2017)? that's it. that's the only way autonomous vehicles and
machines in general will viably work in public spaces. on very clear
specifications + guard rails, and very clear consequences for the humans who
decide to cross them.

why does this work?

because here, we're clearly marking the boundary between entities who
have a stake in ethical decision making (humans), and the entities that don't (machines).
This makes sure that all agency _stays_ with the human, who literally has
skin in the game.

(also, dragging up what i've written previously about
a similar report by VICE:
https://github.com/zeddee/reading-list/blob/master/moral-machine-draft.md)

What I haven't address here:

- Ethical capacity of machines — or are machines worth caring about.
This is a question we have to consider, the closer human augmentation
(e.g mobile phones as prosthetic brain, cybernetic prosthesis, etc.)
brings us to sharing physiology with machines,
and (maybe) AI bringing machines
closer to sharing human psychology/psychiatry, we have to consider
all states, intermediate and at the ends of "human" and "machine",
in relation to ethics and how it applies to them/us.
- what are the ethics we're talking about. so far, most articles
that attempt to address machine ethics and AI fail to address this
question and defer to a vague understanding of kantian deontology + 
aristotelean do-unto-others + john stuart mill's utilitarianism.
All of which is insufficient because that just provides the rules
we know. But here we're moving very quickly and deeply into different
ethical territory where agency and the ethical subject is being located
very differently.

(found an article on VICE by

that gets into some of this)

=== More more Moral Machines

Brett Frischmann, "How Self-Driving Car Policy Will Determine Life, Death and Everything In-Between",
published 23 Mar 2018 on VICE.
Available: https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/j5a8d3/self-driving-car-policy-uber
(link:{assetdir}/frischmann-self-driving-policy.pdf[pdf])

Frischmann gets a lot right in his VICE article, which I just found:

[quote]
____
Who should get decision-making power? Should it be politicians? The market? Insurance companies? Automotive executives? Technologists? Should consumers be allowed to customize the moral dashboard of their cars so that their vehicles execute moral decisions that are in line with their own preferences?

Don’t be fooled when people talk about AI as if it alleviates the need for human beings to make these moral decisions, as if AI necessarily will take care of everything for us. Sure, AI can be designed to make emergent, non-transparent, and even inexplicable decisions. But since the shift from human drivers to passive passengers in self-driving cars shifts decision-making from drivers to designers and programmers, governance remains essential. It’s only a question of which form of governance gets adopted.
____

Takeaways:

* We need more specifics re: consequences.
Frischmann gets into some of this in his article by:
** Listing and making explicit the "moral priorit[ies]" that the Moral Machines experiment assumes.
+
[quote]
____
How, then, should it determine moral priority?

Consider the following possibilities:

* Your car should stay in its lane and absorbs the damage, thereby making it likely that you’ll die.
* Your car should save your life by swerving into the left lane and hitting the car there, sending the passengers to their deaths—passengers known, according to their big data profiles, to have several small children.
* Your car should save your life by swerving into the right lane and hit the car there, sending the lone passenger to her death—a passenger known, according to her big data profile, to be a scientist who is coming close to finding a cure for cancer.
* Your car should save the lives worth the most, measured according to amount of money paid into a new form of life assurance insurance. Assume that each person in a vehicle could purchase insurance against these types of rare but inevitable accidents, and then, smart cars would prioritize based on their ability and willingness to pay.
* Your car should save your life and embrace a neutrality principle in deciding among the means for doing so, perhaps by flipping a simulated coin and swerving to the right if heads comes up and swerving to the left if its tails.
* Your car shouldn’t prioritize your life and should embrace a neutrality principle by randomly choosing among the three options.
* Your car should execute whatever option most closely matches your personal value system and the moral choices you would have made if you were capable of doing so. Assume that when you first purchased your car, you took a self-driving car morality test consisting of a battery of scenarios like this one and that the results “programmed” your vehicle.

There’s no value-free way to determine what the autonomous car should do. **The choice presented by options 1–7 shouldn’t be seen as a computational problem that can be “solved” by big data, sophisticated algorithms, machine learning, or any form of artificial intelligence.** These tools can help evaluate and execute options, but **ultimately, someone -- some human beings -- must choose and have their values baked into the software.**
____
** Listing accidents that don't result in death, but cause bodily harm. He asks how are these accounted for by policy?
+
[quote]
____
Let’s focus on accidents. Self-driving cars will reduce the number of accidents, but again, do not be fooled by the siren’s call of perfection. There still will be accidents that cause:

- considerable bodily loss, such as the loss of limbs, but not death;
- considerable bodily damage that disables the injured person for 24 months;
- considerable mental damage that limits the injured person's ability to ride in an automobile and forces the person to use less efficient modes of transportation;
- considerable damage to the person's vehicle; or
- damage and delays.
____

And a brilliant kicker:

[quote]
____
Traffic management is a form of social planning. Decisions that get made in any single instance of solving the trolley problem, or any of the other scenarios we’ve noted, reflect broader governing principles and ethical logics embedded in technology. These decisions aggregate and over time become social patterns. So, don’t be fooled when engineers hide behind technical efficiency and proclaim to be free from moral decisions. “I’m just an engineer” isn’t an acceptable response to ethical questions. When engineered systems allocate life, death and everything in between, the stakes are inevitably moral.

=== EFF's Face Off White Paper

To read: https://www.eff.org/wp/law-enforcement-use-face-recognition

From their exec summary:

[quote]
____
Face recognition is poised to become one of the most pervasive surveillance technologies, and law enforcement’s use of it is increasing rapidly. Today, law enforcement officers can use mobile devices to capture face recognition-ready photographs of people they stop on the street; surveillance cameras boast real-time face scanning and identification capabilities; and federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies have access to hundreds of millions of images of faces of law-abiding Americans. On the horizon, law enforcement would like to use face recognition with body-worn cameras, to identify people in the dark, to match a person to a police sketch, or even to construct an image of a person’s face from a small sample of their DNA.

However, the adoption of face recognition technologies like these is occurring without meaningful oversight, without proper accuracy testing of the systems as they are actually used in the field, and without the enactment of legal protections to prevent internal and external misuse. This has led to the development of unproven, inaccurate systems that will impinge on constitutional rights and disproportionately impact people of color.

Without restrictive limits in place, it could be relatively easy for the government and private companies to build databases of images of the vast majority of people living in the United States and use those databases to identify and track people in real time as they move from place to place throughout their daily lives. As researchers at Georgetown posited in 2016, one out of two Americans is already in a face recognition database accessible to law enforcement.

"So they will win. [...] Life is a game, and they will win!"
So then I realised that there are at least two categories of people
in the world: people who, like one of my friends, knows
exactly how many hours they need to spend with their wife,
knows exactly the balance of the happiness they get from their
money versus the their things, and they can basically describe
to you in, sort of, metrics, how they measure happiness.
If they can optimize for happiness, they win at life.
And so if you believe that life is a game you can win at, then you
can probably imagine that a computer can beat you at life.

But if you believe that life is not a game, like I do,
like I believe that I'm a bunch of chemicals and molecular
interactions, and every morning I wake up my endocrine
system tells me what I yearn to do that day.
And my life is about trying to fulfill the yearnings
that come through, not just my endocrine system but
my relationships and my existence in the world, and
that we have somewhat a spiritual idea that we have
a consciousness, and we have an understanding.
And the word understanding is very interesting:
when you hear people who describe OpenAI,
they get so much- they get so good at this [building AI] that
the machine understands what's going on.
That's a pretty interesting use of the word "understanding".

Deadbeat debtors in North China's Hebei province will find it more difficult to abscond as the Higher People's Court of Hebei on Monday introduced a mini-program on WeChat targeting them.

Called "a map of deadbeat debtors", the program allows users to find out whether there are any debtors within 500 meters.

The debtor's information is available to check in the program, making it easier for people to whistle-blow on debtors capable of paying their debts.

"It's a part of our measures to enforce our rulings and create a socially credible environment," said a spokesman of the court.

==== Go modules

* Packages downloaded by `go.mod` are stored in `$GOPATH/pkg/mod/<domain>/<repo_owner>/<pkgname>@<pkgver>`
* For example, `v1.8.20` of the `github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum` package is stored as
`$GOPATH/pkg/mod/github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum@v1.8.20`

go tools:

* Start a Go documentation server that serves a site locally,
and contains API documentation for standard library packages
_and_ every single package you've downloaded with `go get`
+
[source,bash]
----
# anywhere
godoc -http :9999
----

* Print to terminal the godoc for `<packagename> [<exportedVar/Func>]`
+
[source, bash]
----
go doc <packagename> <exportedVar/Func>
----
+
e.g.: ``go doc ethereum/go-ethereum/accounts/abi JSON``

* Print to terminal any possible issues with your code
(that are not errors):
+
[source, bash]
----
# In project directory
go vet
----

* Unit testing
** `<filename>_test.go`

[source, go]
----
package main
import "testing"
func TestHandler(t *testing.T) {
    // ...test

To create a mock `http.ResponseWriter` in a test:

[source, go]
----
import (
    "net/http/httptest"
    ...
)

func TestHandler(t *testing.T) {
    req, _ := http.NewRequest(http.MethodGet, ... )
    rec := httptest.NewRecorder()
    handler(rec, req)

    if rec.Code != http.StatusOK {
        t.Errorf("expected http status 200; got %d", rec.Code)
    }

    if !strings.Contains(rec.Body.String(), "substring to test for") {
        t.Errorf("unexpected body in response: %q", rec.Body.String())
    }
}

func TestHandler(t *testing.T) {
    // table driven tests
    cases := []struct{
        in, expectedOutput string
    }{
        {"what we get", "what we expect"}, // this is case 1
        {"case 2 input", "what we want for case 2"},
    }

    for _, c := range cases{
        req, _ := http.NewRequest(http.MethodGet, "https://localhost:8080" + c.in, nil )
        rec := httptest.NewRecorder()
        handler(rec, req)

        if rec.Code != http.StatusOK {
            t.Errorf("expected http status 200; got %d", rec.Code)

[quote]
SDP is the protocol used to exchange  media information between SIP endpoints, and it has also been chosen by IETF and W3C to exchange media information in WebRTC. A WebRTC peer uses SDP to inform the other end about which transport protocols, ports, codecs and  other parameters to use in a media session.

=== Dealing with WebDAV folders

WebDAV is a file sharing protocol that allows you to
mount a http/https url as a folder on your local machine.
This lets you interact with it as if it was a local folder
on your hard disk.

Most of the time, you should be using S/FTP, SSH to access a foreign file system
on the internet. But sometimes, you'll run across a situation where
a cheap hosting solutions provider's plan just doesn't let you do it,
or your hosting configuration has been mangled somehow.

You can mount a WebDAV folder in two ways:

. Using your OS's file manager.
** *macOS*: In a Finder window, hit `cmd+k` and enter the url of your WebDAV endpoint. When you hit enter, it should be mounted as a network drive.
** *Windows*: 
... In Windows Explorer, right-click the *Network* location and select *Map Network Drive*.
... In Windows 10, there should be a text link at the bottom of the box that pops up, 
asking you to click it if you want to
"Connect to a Web site that you can use to store your documents and pictures".
Click that.
... Follow the on-screen instructions.

This usually gives you a sketchy connection, since a HTTP/HTTPS WebDAV connection is nowhere near as stable as
an SSH tunnel, and isn't as resilient as S/FTP. This usually isn't a problem, but when using such a connection
with your local file manager (Finder/Windows Explorer), it causes problems because file managers expect
stable and consistent connections. They'll freak out and start acting weird should the connection drop.
I've spent hours having to repeat work over and over again because Finder would stop responding when
a WebDAV connection drops or times out; it just doesn't know how to respond.

Enter solution 2:

[start=2]
. Using Cyberduck CLI (recommended)
** Install on macOS with `brew install duck`
** Run with:
+
[source,bash]
----
duck -u username -p password -l davs://<url>/<directory_to_list>/
duck -u username -p password -d davs://<url>/<file_to_download>
duck -u username -p password -d davs://<url>/<directory_to_download>/ # you must add a trailing slash to download dirs
----

Because Cyberduck is made for FTP connections, it handles WebDAV connections like FTP connections: that is, if a connection drops,
it knows not to keep waiting for it, but breaks the dropped connection and retries, while keeping track of the progress of any file
transfers etc. Saved me my sanity, and a bucketload of time (wish I'd found it sooner).

[quote, Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field]
____
In mathematics, a finite field or Galois field (so-named in honor of Évariste Galois) is a field that contains a finite number of elements. As with any field, a finite field is a set on which the operations of multiplication, addition, subtraction and division are defined and satisfy certain basic rules. The most common examples of finite fields are given by the integers mod p when p is a prime number.
____
** e.g. a Galois Field of 2 limits you to two values only. It can be '0' and '1' (binary).

=== Importance of diff tools

- Diff tools allow you to quickly compare documents.
- Advanced diff tools can even allow comparisons between images (not just a file level change).
- Valuable when someone sends you a changed file
and doesn't tell you what has changed exactly.
- Valuable when you want to keep track of what you've
added in each iteration of the document.
- Even more valuable if you're keeping track of these changes
in a log e.g. day 1: change A; day 2: change B;
- Can see how this can be useful in the commit history
of this repository: https://github.com/zeddee/reading-list/commits/master

==== Using the Git `diff` tool in the command line

- `xcode-select --install` installs, among other things, `git`.
- Allows you to run `git diff <file1> <file2>` to  show the difference between files.
- Of course, this works best with text files.
- This works best if you're doing this with text files where you expect
to find differences that are useful. e.g. It is not useful to run `git diff`
on two entirely different text documents, or on two text documents where one is
a significant rework of the other.
- To work with word docs, save as plain text files (not rich text).
- Or, alternatively, convert with `pandoc -f docx -t markdown <source_filename.docx> -o <destination_filename.md>`
and diff the resulting `.md` file.

According to Abidin, Everyman Empathy is crucial to the brands of even the biggest YouTube success stories. Much has been made about the concord influencers create with their followers — and how that’s made them un-cancelable in a political climate that’s otherwise quick to judgment. Fewer, though, have noticed that growing media scrutiny has given Kjellberg a way to humanize himself and deflect legitimate criticism. His proletariat gamer roots reappear on cue every time a media outlet like Vox takes his own words seriously.

The research on this is well-established. PewDiePie has put out a video a day for seven years. When he walks up to the line (or goes flying over it) he does so confident that his audience will be with him out of a loyalty built up over thousands of intimate videos. Alt-right shout-outs are flagrant fouls to outsiders, but young fans of YouTubers regard them as personal friends and even family members, and defend them as such. This is why Logan Paul barely lost a step after posting a fresh suicide on his channel, or why JonTron is back to making his usual gamer diatribes two years after publicly expressing his phrenology takes. The browbeating is never going to beat the infrastructure, emotional and otherwise.

I’ve personally grown tired of the media waiting for a point of no return on YouTube. PewDiePie is not going to change, and the culture in his wake is not going to change. What can change is the way we go about our coverage to re-estabish the trust and credibility needed to challenge dangerous political currents in the community.

=== Citing data

https://dataverse.org/best-practices/data-citation

Data citation standard recommended by the _Hardvard Dataverse Project_

[quote]
____
The citation standard defined here offers proper recognition to authors as well as permanent identification through the use of global, persistent identifiers in place of URLs, which can change frequently. Use of universal numerical fingerprints (UNFs) guarantees to the scholarly community that future researchers will be able to verify that data retrieved is identical to that used in a publication decades earlier, even if it has changed storage media, operating systems, hardware, and statistical program format.

Following are two authentic examples of replication data citations:

From International Studies Quarterly, King and Zeng, 2006, p. 209:

    Gary King; Langche Zeng, 2006, “Replication data for: When Can History be Our Guide? The Pitfalls of Counterfactual Inference”, Harvard Dataverse, V2, http://hdl.handle.net/1902.1/DXRXCFAWPKUNF:3:DaYlT6QSX9r0D50ye+tXpA==

From Political Analysis, Hanmer, Banks, and White, 2013:

    Hanmer, Michael J.; Banks, Antoine J., White, Ismail K., 2013, “Replication data for: Experiments to Reduce the Over-reporting of Voting: A Pipeline to the Truth”, Harvard Dataverse, V1, http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/22893 UNF:5:eJOVAjDU0E0jzSQ2bRCg9g==

This citation has seven components. Five are human readable: the author(s), title, year, data repository (or distributor), and version number. Two components are machine-readable:

- Of the machine-readable components to these citations, the unique global identifier begins with either “hdl” (this refers to the international HANDLE.NET system) or “doi” (this refers to a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) system). This identifier is designed to persist even if URLs–or the web itself–are replaced with something else. When the citation appears online, the identifier is hot-linked to the URL that references the identifier, which works in browsers available today. In print, the URL is also included in the citation.
- The universal numerical fingerprint begins with “UNF”. Four features make the UNF especially useful: The UNF algorithm’s cryptographic technology ensures that the alphanumeric identifier will change when any portion of the data set changes. Not only does this assure future researchers that they can use the same data set referenced in a years-old journal article, it enables the data set’s owner to track each iteration of the owner’s research. When an original data set is updated or incorporated into a new, related data set, the algorithm generates a unique UNF each time. The UNF is determined by the content of the data, not the format in which it is stored. For example, you create a data set in SPSS, Stata or R, and five years later, you need to look at your data set again, but the data was converted to the next big thing (NBT). You can use NBT, recompute the UNF, and verify for certain that the data set you’re downloading is the same one you created originally. That is, the UNF will not change. Knowing only the UNF, journal editors can be confident that they are referencing a specific data set that never can be changed, even if they do not have permission to see the data. In a sense, the UNF is the ultimate summary statistic. The UNF’s noninvertible, cryptographic properties guarantee that acquiring the UNF of a data set conveys no information about the content of the data. Authors can take advantage of this property to distribute the full citation of a data set–including the UNF–even if the data is proprietary or highly confidential, all without the risk of disclosure.

=== Interesting bits from IBM's use of AI in psychiatry

* Changelog — Practical AI, Episode #27: IBM's AI for detecting neurological state
with Ajay Royyuru and Guillermo Cecchi from IBM Healthcare
** https://changelog.com/practicalai/27
** Transcript: https://github.com/thechangelog/transcripts/blob/master/practicalai/practical-ai-27.md

Takeaways:

* Focus is on augmenting current psychiatric healthcare practitioners, and not replace them:
+
[quote, Ajay Royyuru]
____
The diagnosis and possible help to the patient, whether it is in terms of diagnosing or in terms of treating, is being done by the licensed expert practitioner. So all that we are doing is using this tool we are making sure that the patient's own experience is being captured sufficiently well. Features that are clinically relevant, like the ones that Guillermo was describing are actually being captured and surfaced, and it is on the basis of those features that a trained practitioner would actually then be prompted to do what they are trained to and licensed to do already.

So this is augmentation, it's not attempting to do what the practitioner does already, which is diagnose a treatment. So the report actually has both graphical, as well as numerical and textual form of these features being surfaced, whether they are in a graph, or the disjoint thoughts that Guillermo was talking about can typically be presented in a graph form. So you either have disjoint graphs, or an extremely complex graph that is actually demonstrating the complexity of the word choices in the context that the person is talking about. And a trained psychiatrist is actually then able to look at that, and as they're accustomed to, use those features to actually then be able to make better decisions.

The most easy way in which this might get used is for screening purposes. A psychiatrist in the future might actually be getting this kind of report, just to keep tabs on what is happening in the life of a person who needs to be watched, and you are using that to actually just watch and screen. And when it gets to a threshold of some concern, you're actually indeed intervening; the practitioner at that point is intervening, and doing what they are trained to do, but now you actually have extended the observation to the life of the person, and you're able to observe more thoroughly and act upon it before it becomes catastrophic. I think that's the more likely usage here. Diagnosing and treating by itself is actually the hardest problem, and that we really need to have practitioners do.

* Lots of stuff on how semantics of spoken language are indicators of mental health conditions.
+
[quote, Guillermo Cecchi]
____
On the other side, we study the causes, and one essential component of what defines a psychotic state of a person is what psychiatrists call flight of ideas. That is the notion that these patients maybe are talking about something, and very dramatically jump the topic to something completely unrelated. So what we did there was using NLP techniques create an algorithm that will detect those jumps using another technique called semantic embedding, that is very commonly used in NLP.
____
** I know this is present in Lacanian psychoanalysis (mirror stage, alienated subject),
but it's interesting to see how its quantified and used in contemporary psychiatry
and in its algorithimic implementation.
** More details on what kind of language features they look out for (algorithmically, and in psychiatric practice):
+
[quote, Guillermo Cecchi]
____
Absolutely, yes. We work, as Ajay was saying, with either clinical interviews, or speech samples that are gathered having clinical evaluation in mind. We have monologue speech samples, we have written text in some cases, and we also have dialogue in other cases. The context is that we either have semi-structured clinical interviews - those seem to be the most effective; by semi-structured I mean it's not following a very precise structure flow of questions and follow-ups, but trying to nudge the patient into talking about something and expressing themselves.

In other cases we have a monologue with anchor subjects. In some cases it can be very short, and we typically target naturalistic samples. For instance, we ask the patients to talk about a typical day in their life, or how their week was, or where they would like for vacation, because the idea is that with those types of prompts - we can reuse them, as Ajay was saying, on a weekly or even daily basis, so we can monitor their state.

Then what we do with the data is - yeah, of course, in the case of speech we have audio files, and we process them as such. We extract voice features that are very well established in the field of voice processing, we extract features related to, for instance, the pause distribution between words, the phoneme structure, something that's called the "vowel space" -- it's how you pronounce your vowels -- that might be different for instance across different accents even in the same language.

Then on the lexical side we extract the expected low-level features, so we can parse sentences into their grammatical components, so we can understand how verbs and nouns and adjectives are used and where in the sentence; that has shown to be important in certain conditions.

We also extract -- as I was saying, the idea of semantic embedding... That allows us to take a word or a sentence and have a notion of how similar that word is to other words. We can use target words that are of interest for the particular condition, and understand how the patient in their discourse is getting closer in meaning or farther in meaning for certain concepts that are relevant..

And then we also extract higher-level features... Those are more aligned with, as I was saying, concepts from psychiatry. Just to give you an example, we have algorithms that can measure how metaphorical the content of a phrase is, and that is relevant in psychosis because one of the symptoms of psychosis is in disruption of your appreciation of metaphors, both in terms of how you understand them and how you produce them.

That gives you an idea of the full spectrum of features that we analyze, we study, from the audio and from the text side of language.

\[...\]

It comes natural for us humans to do it, but any disruption in the health of your brain will have immediately an effect in language. Like I said, even for conditions that traditionally have been considered motor disorders of Parkinson's, we know and we've found (and we are not the only ones who have found) very clear effects in language, and even in content. Even if you have something that supposedly is a motor dysfunction, the content of what you are producing as you speak is affected.

We can talk about \[unintelligible 00:24:29.00\] a feature that seems to be popping up often. One is the one I mentioned, that we originally developed for psychosis - the idea of measuring flight of ideas as semantic coherence. That seems to be useful to analyze different conditions, and even situations in which, for instance, a patient may take a psychoactive drug like Ecstasy or methamphetamine.

But if I had to answer your question, I would say that every single aspect of language is affected... Of course, differently, but it's affected because again, language is a very complex phenomenon that involves many, many different aspects of brain function. Any tiny disruption will have an effect.

* If you try and run `geth` on Docker, `geth` parses the mounted local path of the `datadir` as its path,
rather than its path in the container.
* This becomes an issue if your local mount path is long.
* That's because `geth` throws a 
`Fatal: Error starting protocol stack: listen unix <container_path>/tmp/geth.ipc: bind: file name too long` error and stops
if the total number of characters for the path to`geth.ipc` is longer than 107 characters
(see https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/16342).
* For example:
+
[source, bash]
----
# Running the following throws a "file name too long" error,
# because the resulting path "/tmp/95charlocalpath_adsad.../tmp/geth.ipc" is 108 characters long.
mkdir /tmp/95charlocalpath_adsadsfadfadfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdadfadsfadsfadsfasdfasdfasdfada
cd /tmp/95charlocalpath_adsadsfadfadfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdadfadsfadsfadsfasdfasdfasdfada
docker run -ti --rm -v $(pwd):/tmp ethereum/client-go:alltools-v1.8.20 geth --dev

# But this works
mkdir /tmp/94charlocalpath_adsadsfadfadfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdadfadsfadsfadsfasdfasdfasdfad
cd /tmp/94charlocalpath_adsadsfadfadfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdadfadsfadsfadsfasdfasdfasdfad
docker run -ti --rm -v $(pwd):/tmp ethereum/client-go:alltools-v1.8.20 geth --dev
----

* The examples above run `geth --dev`, so `geth.ipc` is always on `/tmp/geth.ipc` (13 chars) in the container.
* When running `geth` on the mainnet or testnet, this path would be
`/root/.ethereum/geth/geth.ipc` (29 chars)
or `/root/.ethereum/<testnet>/geth.ipc` (32 chars for rinkeby)
respectively.
* Solution: Only mount local machine directories that are shorter than `107 - <container_path_length>` characters as the `datadir`

https://www.coindesk.com/ethereums-constantinople-upgrade-faces-delay-due-to-security-vulnerability

- Blockchain audit firm ChainSecurity found and disclosed a security vulnerability
in link:https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1283.md[EIP 1283]
one of the five improvements to be included in the chain upgrade.
- The vulnerability found by ChainSecurity apparently allows a *reentrancy* attack.

[quote]
____
The bug, found in Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1283, would have allowed malicious actors to essentially withdraw funds “forever” in what is known as a re-entrancy attack. 

Typically gas costs on the ethereum network can prevent such attacks. However, EIP 1283 would have lowered gas costs significantly, to the point where re-entrancy attacks could be executed in certain smart contracts. 
____
- EIP 1283 is a proposed improvement to how gas costs for storing data on-chain is calculated (? correct?)
- Specifically an improvement to "gas metering" on `SSTORE`, which is the

== Content Strategy

=== What is content strategy?

Kristina Halvorson, "What is Content Strategy? Connecting the Dots Between Disciplines",
publisehd on _Brain Traffic_. Available: https://www.braintraffic.com/blog/what-is-content-strategy

Takeways:

* Content strategy connects the dots between:
** UXD — identifying user needs and how to get it to them effectively. Usability.
** Editorial strategy — angle, goal, distribution,
internal content goals e.g. what info we need to put out there that's missing.
** Content engineering — (first i've seen this term) basically information architecture.
progressive revelation, findability, wayfinding etc.
** Content workflow and governance — basically editorial workflow + checks.
* Macro definitions:
** Content strategy guides the creation, delivery, and governance of useful, usable content.
** Content strategy means getting the right content, to the right people, in the right place, at the right time.
** Content strategy is an integrated set of user-centered, goal-driven choices about content throughout its lifecycle.

\[...\] instead of just asking about the accuracy of the information, I also find myself asking questions such as:

- Is this a unique JOA technology?
- What benefit does this offer our customers?
- Is this above and beyond what our competitors offer?
- This is better in comparison to what? How should I phrase that?
- What should be emphasized here?
- What is going to make them want to hire JOA?
- What other flexibility can we offer our customers here? If I advertise this, can we deliver on that?

Not really conscious of the convergence, maybe because
of my own (brief) background in marketing/advertising.
Perhaps a good thing — technical writing has a sense of
structure and rigour (that can be a bit overbearing at times, 
especially in certain expectations of it), but that's something it can
bring to marketing to temper some of the

The system consists of a wearable device and an associated computing system. Electrodes in the device pick up neuromuscular signals in the jaw and face that are triggered by internal verbalizations — saying words “in your head” — but are undetectable to the human eye. The signals are fed to a machine-learning system that has been trained to correlate particular signals with particular words.

“We basically can’t live without our cellphones, our digital devices,” says Pattie Maes, a professor of media arts and sciences and Kapur’s thesis advisor. “But at the moment, the use of those devices is very disruptive. If I want to look something up that’s relevant to a conversation I’m having, I have to find my phone and type in the passcode and open an app and type in some search keyword, and the whole thing requires that I completely shift attention from my environment and the people that I’m with to the phone itself. So, my students and I have for a very long time been experimenting with new form factors and new types of experience that enable people to still benefit from all the wonderful knowledge and services that these devices give us, but do it in a way that lets them remain in the present.”

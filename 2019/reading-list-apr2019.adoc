=== Golang data structures

Ilija Eftimov, "Golang Datastructures: Trees", published 13 Feb 2019.

* Trees are non-linear data structures
** "Linear" data structures have a start and an end, e.g. arrays, lists, queues, stacks.
** Trees are also known as hierarchical data structures.
** From wiki:

____
A tree is a data structure made up of nodes or vertices and edges without having any cycle. The tree with no nodes is called the null or empty tree. A tree that is not empty consists of a root node and potentially many levels of additional nodes that form a hierarchy.
____
** "no cycle" means that terminal nodes in a tree are unique, and don't have more than one parent.
** HTML is a document format that uses a tree data structure called the DOM (document object model) to organize data.

BFS:

* Breadth First Search
** Traverses a tree by exploring the nodes "in width" first.
** This searches a tree by stepping through each level in a tree and vists each node in that level before moving to the next level.
** Example code that performs BFS:
+
[source, go]
====
func findById(root *Node, id string) *Node {
        queue := make([]*Node, 0)
        queue = append(queue, root)
        for len(queue) > 0 {
                nextUp := queue[0]
                queue = queue[1:]
                if nextUp.id == id {
                        return nextUp
                }
                if len(nextUp.children) > 0 {
                        for _, child := range nextUp.children {
                                queue = append(queue, child)
                        }
                }
        }
        return nil
}
====

DFS:

* Correspondingly, DFS is a Depth First Search, where searching a tree will pick a node and visit the first unexplored child of each node it encounters, until it reaches a terminal node. When it reaches a terminal node, it returns to the top of the tree, and repeats the process.
** Example implementation of DFS traversal:
+
[source, go]
====
func findByIdDFS(node *Node, id string) *Node {
        if node.id == id {
                return node
        }

        if len(node.children) > 0 {
                for _, child := range node.children {
                        findByIdDFS(child, id)
                }
        }
        return nil
}

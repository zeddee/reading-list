== Human interactions

=== Plants as interface

https://www.dezeen.com/2019/06/17/mit-researchers-engineer-cyborg-plants/

Use plants as interface that can sense input,
and physically move to signal output. 

Basically plant as screen.

____
The team's two new projects, titled Phytoactuators and Planta Digitalis respectively, focus on human interaction. They use plants for sensing and display â€” the two essential elements that complete an interaction loop.

This means that a person can tell a plant to do something, and the plant can also communicate some information back.

[...]

The researchers suggest this functionality could be used to send people notifications, in effect turning the plant into a display. A jiggle from the stem or an arrangement of closed leaves might indicate rain outside, the arrival of a package or some other simple information.

In the second project, Planta Digitalis, the researchers grew a conductive "wire" inside the plant by sitting it in the water-soluble polymer ProDOT. They could then connect this wire to other instruments, turning the plant into an antenna or sensor.

They suggest that with this functionality, the plant could be an inconspicuous motion sensor, sending an alert to people when it detected intruders or wayward pets.
____

- surveillance applications?
- use plants as display components e.g. pixels?

____
"Plants are self-repairing, self-regenerating organisms available at scale," they said. "Through Cyborg Botany, we envision a convergent design world in which we reappropriate our natural capabilities for a new bio-interaction design."

=== Ken Thompson and the strongest DES 8-character password

https://leahneukirchen.org/blog/archive/2019/10/ken-thompson-s-unix-password.html

Interesting account of how Ken Thompson, one of computing's pioneers and
most recently one of the brains behind the Go programming language at Google,
made a DES password that was difficult to crack because he chose a combination
of characters that was the most difficult for a computer to crack via brute force,
even though the encryption algorithm itself is considered weak.

____
The lowest resonant frequency of a vibrating object is called its fundamental frequency. Most vibrating objects have more than one resonant frequency and those used in musical instruments typically vibrate at harmonics of the fundamental. A harmonic is defined as an integer (whole number) multiple of the fundamental frequency. Vibrating strings, open cylindrical air columns, and conical air columns will vibrate at all harmonics of the fundamental. Cylinders with one end closed will vibrate with only odd harmonics of the fundamental. Vibrating membranes typically produce vibrations at harmonics, but also have some resonant frequencies which are not harmonics. It is for this class of vibrators that the term overtone becomes useful - they are said to have some non-harmonic overtones.

- A harmonic is an integer multiple of a fundamental frequency.
- A fundamental frequency is the lowest frequency of a resonating system i.e.
a system that has a consistent periodic waveform.
- A subharmonic is then a waveform that is at a frequency that is
a fractional multiple of a fundamental frequency.

== Human interactions

=== Plants as interface

https://www.dezeen.com/2019/06/17/mit-researchers-engineer-cyborg-plants/

Use plants as interface that can sense input,
and physically move to signal output. 

Basically plant as screen.

____
The team's two new projects, titled Phytoactuators and Planta Digitalis respectively, focus on human interaction. They use plants for sensing and display â€” the two essential elements that complete an interaction loop.

This means that a person can tell a plant to do something, and the plant can also communicate some information back.

[...]

The researchers suggest this functionality could be used to send people notifications, in effect turning the plant into a display. A jiggle from the stem or an arrangement of closed leaves might indicate rain outside, the arrival of a package or some other simple information.

In the second project, Planta Digitalis, the researchers grew a conductive "wire" inside the plant by sitting it in the water-soluble polymer ProDOT. They could then connect this wire to other instruments, turning the plant into an antenna or sensor.

They suggest that with this functionality, the plant could be an inconspicuous motion sensor, sending an alert to people when it detected intruders or wayward pets.
____

- surveillance applications?
- use plants as display components e.g. pixels?

____
"Plants are self-repairing, self-regenerating organisms available at scale," they said. "Through Cyborg Botany, we envision a convergent design world in which we reappropriate our natural capabilities for a new bio-interaction design."
